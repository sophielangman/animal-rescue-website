      <p class="gutter micro">Freedom Dog Rescue is a non-profit registered charity which was founded in Ottawa in February 2015. We are an all-breed, all-size foster based rescue which operates in Ottawa and surrounding areas.  Registered Charity #783761323RR0001Non-Profit Corporation #9629629<br>We are dedicated to rescuing homeless and abandoned dogs, dogs from shelters and taking in desperate owner surrenders when they can no longer care for them. We do so by working with committed volunteers, foster homes local veterinarians, and trainers. We are able to rescue dogs in need and provide them with loving temporary care until a well-matched carefully screened “furever home” is found. Our fosters and volunteers are the heart and soul of Freedom Dog Rescue, and the reason we are able to successfully rescue and adopt out so many deserving dogs. We truly are like a family of friends and in some cases we actually are family and it’s just so amazing that we can share our passion together and have so much fun doing it. Being a foster based rescue means that any dog in care with us is placed in a loving foster home and not in a kennel environment.  We strongly believe that they have gone through enough hardship in their lives and all of our foster families are devoted to showing the dogs in our care how to be part of a family and feel loved. We are so appreciative of our foster families who work very hard to give these dogs a second chance at a happy life. We are extremely grateful for your endless support in helping Freedom Dog Rescue become who we are today and what we will become in the future.</p>
